# undefined vs not defined in JS

## undefined in JavaScript

**Meaning:** A variable is declared but has no value assigned.

**Happens when:**

- You declare a variable but don't initialize it.
- A function parameter is missing in a call.
- You explicitly assign undefined.

**Example:**

```javascript
var a;
console.log(a); // undefined

function greet(name) {
  console.log(name);
}
greet(); // undefined
```

**Key Points:**

- undefined is a special value in JavaScript.
- Declared variables are hoisted and initialized to undefined (in the creation phase).
- It's a valid value but usually means "no value assigned yet".

## not defined in JavaScript

**Meaning:** The variable has never been declared in the current scope.

**Example:**

```javascript
console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined
```

**Key Points:**

- Accessing an undeclared variable causes a ReferenceError.
- This happens because the variable doesn't exist in memory at all.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature           | undefined                             | not defined                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Declaration       | ✅ Declared                           | ❌ Never declared                   |
| Memory allocation | ✅ Yes (value = undefined)            | ❌ No                               |
| Error on access   | ❌ No error                           | ✅ ReferenceError                   |
| Example           | `var a; console.log(a); // undefined` | `console.log(b); // ReferenceError` |

## Interview Soundbite

"undefined means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value, so it's a value and type in JavaScript. not defined means the variable hasn't been declared at all, so accessing it throws a ReferenceError. Variables declared with var are hoisted and initialized to undefined, while accessing undeclared variables immediately causes an error."

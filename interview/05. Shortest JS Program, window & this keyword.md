# Shortest JS Program, window & this keyword

## Shortest JavaScript Program

**Question interviewers ask:** "What's the shortest valid JavaScript program?"

✅ **Answer:**
An empty file is the shortest JavaScript program.

**Why?**

Even if you write nothing, the JavaScript engine still creates a Global Execution Context (GEC).

The GEC automatically creates:

- Global Object (window in browsers, global in Node.js)
- this keyword (points to the global object in non-strict mode)

So, an empty JS file still runs and gives you:

```javascript
console.log(this); // window in browser
console.log(window); // window object in browser
```

## window Object

In browsers, window is the global object.

It represents the browser window and provides:

- Global variables
- Browser APIs (DOM, timers, fetch, etc.)

All global variables declared with var become properties of window:

```javascript
var a = 10;
console.log(window.a); // 10
```

But let and const do not attach to window:

```javascript
let b = 20;
console.log(window.b); // undefined
```

## this Keyword

this refers to the execution context's owner — it depends on how a function is called.

### Global Scope

- **In non-strict mode:** this → global object (window in browsers).
- **In strict mode:** this → undefined.

```javascript
console.log(this); // window (non-strict)
('use strict');
console.log(this); // undefined
```

### Inside a Function

- **Non-strict mode:** this → global object.
- **Strict mode:** this → undefined.

```javascript
function test() {
  console.log(this);
}
test(); // window (non-strict), undefined (strict)
```

### Inside an Object Method

this → the object that called the method.

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'JS',
  getName: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};
obj.getName(); // "JS"
```

### Arrow Functions

Arrow functions do not have their own this.

They inherit this from the enclosing lexical scope.

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'JS',
  arrow: () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};
obj.arrow(); // undefined (inherited from global scope)
```

## Interview Soundbite

"Even the shortest JS program — an empty file — runs because the engine creates a Global Execution Context with a window object and a this keyword. In browsers, window is the global object, and this in the global scope refers to window in non-strict mode. Inside functions or objects, this changes depending on how the function is called, and arrow functions simply inherit this from their lexical scope."

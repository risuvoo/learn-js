## üéØ Interview Tips

### Key Areas to Focus On:

- **Execution Context & Hoisting**: Foundation of JavaScript behavior
- **Closures**: Critical for advanced JavaScript understanding
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Essential for modern development
- **Promises & Async/Await**: Must-know for any JavaScript role
- **This Keyword**: Common source of confusion in interviews

### Study Strategy:

1. **Start with fundamentals** (Topics 1-10)
2. **Practice coding problems** with each concept
3. **Focus on asynchronous patterns** (Topics 14, 19-23)
4. **Master object-oriented concepts** (Topics 24-25)
5. **Review and practice** interview questions in each section

### Interview Preparation Checklist:

- [ ] Can explain execution context and hoisting
- [ ] Understand closure patterns and use cases
- [ ] Know the difference between var, let, and const
- [ ] Can implement and explain promises
- [ ] Understand async/await and error handling
- [ ] Know this binding rules in different contexts

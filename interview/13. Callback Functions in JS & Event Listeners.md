# Callback Functions in JS & Event Listeners

## What is a Callback Function?

**Definition:**
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is invoked later, either synchronously or asynchronously.

Think of it as: "I'll call you back when I'm ready."

**Example:**

```javascript
function greetUser(name, callback) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
  callback();
}

function sayBye() {
  console.log('Goodbye!');
}

greetUser('JavaScript', sayBye);
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, JavaScript
Goodbye!
```

## Why Callbacks Are Useful

- They allow functions to be reused with different behaviors.
- They handle asynchronous operations (before Promises & async/await became common).
- They help execute code only after something else finishes (e.g., data fetch, timer).

## Callbacks in Asynchronous JS

**Example with setTimeout:**

```javascript
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log('3 seconds passed!');
}, 3000);
```

The function is passed as a callback and executed later by the event loop.

## Event Listeners as Callbacks

Event listeners always require a callback function that runs when the event happens.

**Example:**

```javascript
document.getElementById('btn').addEventListener('click', function () {
  console.log('Button clicked!');
});
```

Here, the anonymous function is the callback.
The browser calls it only when the user clicks the button.

## Named Callback for Reusability

```javascript
function handleClick() {
  console.log('Button clicked!');
}

document.getElementById('btn').addEventListener('click', handleClick);
```

Cleaner, reusable, and easier to remove later:

```javascript
document.getElementById('btn').removeEventListener('click', handleClick);
```

## Callback Hell (Nested Callbacks Problem)

Too many callbacks can cause deeply nested, hard-to-read code:

```javascript
doStep1(function (result1) {
  doStep2(result1, function (result2) {
    doStep3(result2, function (result3) {
      console.log('Done!');
    });
  });
});
```

This led to Promises and async/await in modern JS.

## Interview Soundbite

"A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed later. They're heavily used in JavaScript for async operations like timers, network requests, and event handling. Event listeners are a common real-world example of callbacks â€” you register a function, and the browser 'calls it back' when the event happens."

# let & const in JS, Temporal Dead Zone

## let in JavaScript

**Introduced in ES6.**

- **Block-scoped** → only accessible within the `{}` where they're defined.
- **Hoisted but not initialized** → lives in the Temporal Dead Zone until the declaration line.
- **Can be updated but not re-declared** in the same scope.

**Example:**

```javascript
{
  let a = 10;
  a = 20; // ✅ allowed
  // let a = 30; // ❌ SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
}
```

## const in JavaScript

- Also **block-scoped**.
- **Hoisted but not initialized** → in TDZ until declaration.
- **Must be initialized** at the time of declaration.
- **Cannot be reassigned**, but object/array properties can still be mutated.

**Example:**

```javascript
{
  const b = 50; // ✅ must initialize
  // b = 60; // ❌ TypeError
  const obj = { x: 1 };
  obj.x = 2; // ✅ allowed
}
```

## Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

**Definition:**
The period between entering a scope (block/function) and the actual declaration of a `let` or `const` variable — during which the variable exists but cannot be accessed.

### Key Points:

- Variables in TDZ are hoisted, but not given a default value (`undefined`).
- Accessing them before declaration → `ReferenceError`.
- Prevents accidental usage of variables before initialization.

**Example:**

```javascript
console.log(x); // ReferenceError (TDZ)
let x = 5;
console.log(x); // 5
```

### Why TDZ Exists

- Makes code more predictable.
- Helps catch errors where variables are used before being properly initialized.

## var vs let vs const (Quick Table)

| Feature                    | var               | let      | const    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Scope**                  | Function          | Block    | Block    |
| **Hoisted?**               | Yes               | Yes      | Yes      |
| **Initialized on hoist?**  | Yes (`undefined`) | No (TDZ) | No (TDZ) |
| **Redeclaration allowed?** | Yes               | No       | No       |
| **Reassignment allowed?**  | Yes               | Yes      | No       |

## Interview Soundbite

> "Both `let` and `const` are block-scoped and hoisted, but unlike `var`, they're not initialized until the actual declaration line — the period before that is the **Temporal Dead Zone**. `let` can be reassigned but not redeclared, while `const` must be initialized and can't be reassigned, though its object properties can be changed."

# First Class Functions & Anonymous Functions

## First-Class Functions in JavaScript

**Definition:**
In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they are treated like any other value.

**Implications:**

Functions can be:

- Assigned to variables
- Passed as arguments to other functions
- Returned from other functions
- Stored in data structures (arrays, objects, etc.)

**Example:**

```javascript
// 1. Assigning to a variable
const greet = function (name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
};

// 2. Passing as an argument
function sayHello(fn) {
  console.log(fn('JS'));
}
sayHello(greet);

// 3. Returning from a function
function multiplier(x) {
  return function (y) {
    return x * y;
  };
}
const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10
```

**Interview Soundbite:**
"First-class functions mean functions can be used as values — assigned, passed, and returned — giving JavaScript its functional programming power."

## Anonymous Functions

**Definition:**
An anonymous function is a function without a name in its declaration.

**Key Points:**

- Often used when functions are assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or used in IIFEs.
- Cannot be referenced by name in recursion unless stored in a variable.
- Improves brevity but can make debugging harder (stack traces may lack function names).

**Example:**

```javascript
// Anonymous function assigned to a variable
const greetUser = function (name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
};

// Anonymous function as a callback
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log('Timer done!');
}, 1000);
```

## First-Class Functions + Anonymous Functions Together

This is where interviewers connect the dots:

- Anonymous functions are often used because JavaScript treats functions as first-class.
- Without first-class function behavior, passing anonymous functions as arguments wouldn't be possible.

**Example:**

```javascript
function processUserInput(callback) {
  const name = 'JavaScript';
  callback(name);
}

// Passing an anonymous function as an argument
processUserInput(function (user) {
  console.log(`Welcome, ${user}`);
});
```

## Bonus — Named Function Expressions

You can name the function even when assigning to a variable — helps debugging.

```javascript
const greetUser = function greetFn(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
};
```

**Interview Soundbite:**
"JavaScript supports first-class functions, so they can be treated like variables — assigned, passed, and returned. Anonymous functions are simply functions without names, commonly used as values for first-class functions, especially in callbacks and IIFEs."
